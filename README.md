# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

This is an **Employee Management System** built using **React**. It allows the admin to create tasks for employees, and employees can accept, complete, or fail tasks. The data is stored locally using **localStorage**, and the application ensures that no page reloads will cause a loss of data.

### Key Features:
- **Login Page**: Both employees and admin can log in.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin can assign tasks to employees and track their progress.
- **Employee Dashboard**: Employees can view assigned tasks, accept them, and mark them as complete or failed.
- **Local Storage**: Data is saved to the browser's local storage, allowing the app to maintain its state even after a page reload.

### Tech Stack:
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app.
- **LocalStorage**: For saving and retrieving data on the client-side.
